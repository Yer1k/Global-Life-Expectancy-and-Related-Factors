# Research Proposal

### Selected Dataset

*The team selected the World Health Organization's Life Expectancy Dataset. This dataset contains observations of 193 countries in 20 variables across a roughly ten-year period.*

### Research Question #1

*Research Question #1 will be a prediction question. Our group will explore Life Expectancy in the year 2014 as a function of these possible variables:*

* *Percentage Expenditure*
* *Hepatitis B*
* *Measles*
* *Polio*
* *HIV/AIDS*
* *Diptheria*
* *GDP*
* *Schooling*
* *Income Composition of Resources*
* *Country Status (Developed/Developing)*
* *Population*


***The specific question we will be answer is: "How did major disease, economic, and social factors impact life expectancy around the globe in 2014?"***


### Research Question #2

*Research Question #2 will be inference. Our group will seek to infer a country's category as developed or developing based on the best-fit model.*

***The specific question we will answer is: "How did disease and mortality rates, along with national economic factors, contribute to a country's development status in 2014?"***

# Overview 

*WILL REMOVE: Briefly describe the dataset and research questions*

### Dataset

The dataset used for this research is from the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO compiles data on thousands of variables for as many countries as feasible and presents them for analysis. This particular dataset contains national-level observations of variables related to life expectancy around the globe for a period spanning the early portion of the 21st century. The complete dataset contains observations beginning in the year 2000 and ending in the year 2015. As a complete dataset, there are 2,938 observations for 22 variables. Practically, each country has approximately one observation, averaging 183 for each of the 16 years encompassed by the data. The dataset effectively contains 20 variables for each country and year combination, covering significant disease, economic, and social factors.

### Question #1 (Prediction)

*"How did major disease, economic, and social factors impact life expectancy around the globe in 2014?"*

### Question #2 (Inference)

*"How did disease and mortality rates, along with national economic factors, contribute to a country's development status in 2014?"*


# Models 

*WILL REMOVE: Describe the type of model you will use for each research question. Justify your selections. Also discuss a priori variable selection and any variables you will include.* 

### Question #1 (Prediction)

**Model

**Variable Selection


### Question #2 (Inference)

**Model**

For this inference question, we will utilize logistic regression. We chose this because our outcome variable is a binary status (Developing or Developed), and there is no apparent ordering to these conditions. For this model, we will designate the status "Developing" as the baseline from which we will make inferences. We will use the 2014 subset of the data to train the model and will test its accuracy against country status' for the year 2013.

**Variable Selection**

*A priori* variable selection for this question will be complicated by the WHO's definition of a developing vs. developed country. From research, we can determine a rough framework for this designation, which likely includes an economic and social component in the context of this dataset. We will certainly include 'Life Expectancy' as a variable in this analysis. However, we may need to discard several variables, such as 'GDP' or 'Income composition of resources', before fitting the final model. We may do this because several of these variables may be implicitly included in the categorical designation and therefore outweigh other dataset elements. To satisfactorily address these concerns, we will check for multicollinearity when fitting the final model using a VIF function.

# Challenge

*WILL REMOVE: How do you plan to address the challenges you presented in part 1?*

The most concerning challenge for the second research question is missing values in the data. There are  41x 'Population', 10x 'Hep.B', and 10x 'Schooling' observations that are missing values. In total, these missing variables span 44 countries. When we remove 'Population' as a variable, we still have 31 countries with missing data. In response, we will attempt to find verifiable and high-quality data from other sources to use in place of missing or sentinel values but may be ultimately required to drop those countries from the analysis.

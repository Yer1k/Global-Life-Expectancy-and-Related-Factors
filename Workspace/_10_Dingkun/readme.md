## EDA
Done a little bit EDA on Life Expectancy Data, specifically year 2015 and 2014. For 2015 data, we have a lot missing values on "percentage expenditure" column. We may want to use 2014 data, if we are interested in making "percentage expenditure" as a predictor. 

You may compare "Life-Expectancy-EDA_14.pdf"(2014) and "Life-Expectancy-EDA.pdf"(2015) to have an idea.
